<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a modern React frontend application built with:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** as the build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **CSS Modules** for styling (when needed)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces over types when possible
- Use descriptive component and variable names
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Use proper TypeScript typing for props and state
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use semantic HTML elements

## File Organization
- Components should be placed in `src/components/`
- Types and interfaces in `src/types/`
- Utilities and helpers in `src/utils/`
- Assets (images, icons) in `src/assets/`

## Development Practices
- Always include proper TypeScript types
- Use ESLint and follow the configured rules
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Consider accessibility (a11y) in component design
- Use modern ES6+ features appropriately
